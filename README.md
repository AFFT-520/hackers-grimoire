# Hacker's Grimoire

Hi. This is where I keep my penetration testing notes. It's a work in progress, updated as I learn new things. I also want to help others starting out in this field, so I'm including a lot of links to tutorials, books and lab sites that were helpful to me. [Read it on GitBook](https://conor-rynne62.gitbook.io//hackers-grimoire/), [fork my version](https://github.com/AFFT-520/hackers-grimoire) for your own use.

This version is itself a forked version that I've made with several additions of my own. If you want access to the original version, [here it is](https://github.com/vulp3cula/hackers-grimoire)
