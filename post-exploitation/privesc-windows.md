# Privilege escalation: Windows

If you started hacking on Linux, Windows can be frustrating and weird. But that's what most networks are running, from desktops to domain controllers. So you just have to get used to it.

## Gathering system information
These commands can be issued remotely using a cmd.exe shell.

Get system information:
```
systeminfo
```
Check the OS version:
```
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
```
Check active network connections:
```
netstat -ano
```
Check firewall settings:
```
netsh firewall show state
netsh firewall show config
```
Check scheduled tasks:
```
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```
Check running processes linked to services:
```
tasklist /SVC
```
Check for running services:
```
net start
```
Check for installed drivers:
```
DRIVERQUERY
```
Check for installed patches:
```
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
```
Search for files that contain ‘password’ in the filename:
```
dir /s *password*
```
Search for the keyword ‘password’ in files with the .txt extension:

```
