# Privilege escalation: Windows

If you started hacking on Linux, Windows can be frustrating and weird. But that's what most networks are running, from desktops to domain controllers. So you just have to get used to it.

## Gathering system information
These commands can be issued remotely using a cmd.exe shell.

Get system information:
```
systeminfo
```
Check the OS version:
```
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
```
Check active network connections:
```
netstat -ano
```
Check firewall settings:
```
netsh firewall show state
netsh firewall show config
```
Check scheduled tasks:
```
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```
Check running processes linked to services:
```
tasklist /SVC
```
Check for running services:
```
net start
```
Check for installed drivers:
```
DRIVERQUERY
```
Check for installed patches:
```
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
```
Search for files that contain ‘password’ in the filename:
```
dir /s *password*
```
Search for the keyword ‘password’ in files with the .txt extension:
```
findstr /si password *.txt
```
## Unquoted service path
This is a common vulnerability for installed programs that don't put quotes around the file path to the executable:
```
C:\Program Files\Some Software\Software.exe     #unquoted

"C:\Program Files\Some Software\Software.exe"
```
When Windows tries to locate the program, it guesses and tries to execute any word before a space. For example, in the unquoted service path above, Windows will try:

```
C:\Program.exe

C:\Program Files\Some.exe

C:\Program Files\Some Software\Software.exe
```
An attacker could exploit this behaviour by putting a malicious program earlier in the file path so that Windows executes it before the legitimate one. In order for this to be successful, these conditions must be true:

1. There is a service with an unquoted binary path containing one or more spaces in the path
1. The current user has Write permissions for the folders containing spaces
1. There is a way to reboot the system or service in order to execute a payload
