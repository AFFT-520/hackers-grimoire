# Buffer overflow

Pulling off a simple Win32 buffer overflow is a lot like baking a fancy cake. The [cake recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.ca/recipe/raspberry-mascarpone-black-forest-cake/15205/) is actually a bunch of smaller recipes for the topping, the icing, the layers and the filling. You have to get each mini-recipe exactly right if you want the cake to taste good.

Similarly, a buffer overflow recipe has the following mini-recipes:

**Find the instruction pointer**
* Make a simple script to shove a bunch of garbage into an input field and crash the program
* Find the exact number of characters required to reach the EIP (instruction pointer)

**Make shellcode**
* Find the 'bad' characters that will prevent your exploit from working
* Generate shellcode without bad characters

**Redirect execution of the program**
* Inspect the program's .dll files to find a `JMP ESP` (jump to the stack pointer) command
* Record the memory address for this command

**Assemble the exploit**
* Update your simple script to hit the EIP, jump to the ESP and execute your shellcode
* Throw in a few nops for breathing room
* Don't forget to put the `JMP ESP` memory address in backwards!

If you haven't done this before, many of the terms above will be unfamiliar, but don't worry. Contrary to what some people say, you can do simple buffer overflows without knowing much about Assembly or memory layout. I spent far too much time reading about those things and freaking myself out. All you need to know is [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo).
